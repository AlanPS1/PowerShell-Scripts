Function Invoke-TeamsReprofile {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Invoke-TeamsReprofile is a simple function that will re-profile the MS Teams
    user profile for the Teams desktop client on a windows 10 pc.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This Function will test for MS Teams & MS Outlook running then will close them
    both in advance of re-naming the 'Teams' folder in %APPDATA%. Once the re-naming,
    or re-profiling has occurred it will restart MS Teams & MS Outlook if they were
    previously running
